Title: "Efficient Fuel Consumption Predictions using Non-Linear Polynomial Regression"

Overview: In this project, we aim to predict fuel consumption of new light-duty vehicles in Canada using a non-linear polynomial regression model. The dataset, FuelConsumption.csv, contains model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions. We will utilize libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, and scipy to perform data analysis and build the regression model. The project will involve steps such as importing required packages, downloading the data, understanding the data, reading the data in, building the polynomial regression model, evaluating its performance, and practicing with the model.

Motivation: With increasing concerns about energy efficiency and carbon footprint, accurate prediction of fuel consumption is critical for both consumers and manufacturers. This project provides a hands-on approach to predict fuel consumption using non-linear polynomial regression, helping to better understand the relationship between various factors and fuel consumption.

Learning Objectives:

Learn to import required packages and download the data
Gain knowledge on data analysis and exploration
Get hands-on experience in building non-linear polynomial regression models
Evaluate the performance of the model
Practice using the model to make predictions

Technical Aspects: The technical aspect of this project involves using non-linear polynomial regression to predict fuel consumption. We will be utilizing pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, and scipy to perform data analysis and build the regression model.

Technology Used: pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, scipy, and itertools.

Data Source: FuelConsumption.csv, which contains model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.

Project Structure: The project will consist of the following steps:

Importing required packages
Downloading and understanding the data
Reading the data in
Building the non-linear polynomial regression model
Evaluating the model's performance
Practicing using the model to make predictions

Credits: This project leverages the Canada Fuel consumption ratings dataset for predictions.
